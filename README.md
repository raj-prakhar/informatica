Data Warehousing ETL Process

ETL is an abbreviation of Extract, Transform and Load. In this process, an ETL tool extracts the data from different RDBMS source systems then transforms the data like applying calculations, concatenations, etc. and then load the data into the Data Warehouse system.

It's tempting to think a creating a Data warehouse is simply extracting data from multiple sources and loading into database of a Data warehouse. This is far from the truth and requires a complex ETL process. The ETL process requires active inputs from various stakeholders including developers, analysts, testers, top executives and is technically challenging.

In order to maintain its value as a tool for decision-makers, Data warehouse system needs to change with business changes. ETL is a recurring activity (daily, weekly, monthly) of a Data warehouse system and needs to be agile, automated, and well documented.

In this project we have used Hospital Management System .
We have imported data from different OLTP sources , brought the date into warehouse after transformation
Informatica 10.1 is used as an Etl tool for the project.
